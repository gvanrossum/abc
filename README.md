# The original ABC programming language (CWI)

This was Python's most direct predecessor; I worked on it from around 1983-1986.

I downloaded these sources from [CWI.NL](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/abc/implementations.html),
specifically the abc-unix tarball.

Most files have 1991 as their latest modification; a few have 1996 or 2021.

Another copy of the ABC sources lives in Luciano Ramalho's [GitHub](https://github.com/ramalho/abc/commits/master/ABC).

CWI never put a license on ABC; I'll try to negotiate with Steven Pemberton eventually (hopefully MIT).
